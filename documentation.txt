    Go to method mapApiRoutes() -> remove the prefix method

Laravel 5.4 >
    always include
        Schema::defaultStringLength(191) method inside the AppServiceProvider boot() method

Info
    A string has 255 characters by default

Creating pivot tables
    php artisan make:migration category_product_table --create=category_product

Executing seeders
     Call to a member function attach() on null
        - needed to add the return keyword

Exception handling
     - under the Exceptions folder we find a Handler Class
     - with method render()
        - executed every time an exception occurs
     - method report()
        - executed every time but only to report to the log file
  NotFoundHttpException
  MethodNotAllowedHttpException
  ModelNotFoundException
  AuthenticationException
  AuthorizationException

Implicit Model Binding
     - not using the $id but the Model Class
     - does not apply to all models - in case of special models like the buyer
       we can create a scope to help us add filters to our model.
Scopes
     - Used for filtering a model that inherits from another model

Soft Deletes
     - Helps solve issues with foreign keys


AppServiceProvider
     - Events to be done in this file using the updated method in the model.

Uploading and Storing an Image
     - configure the fileSystem - 'images' => [
                                              'driver' => 'local',
                                              'root' => public_path('img'),
                                              'visibility' => 'public',
                                          ],
     - $request->image->store()

Email  Sending
     - composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle

User Verification
     - change the verified status to verified and remove the verification_token

Mailer
     - php artisan make:mail UserCreated
     - the build method is automatically created
     - to pass the user details to the view file, pass the user through the constructor
       and they will be automatically passed to the view

EventsFlushing
     - Events can be disabled using the Model::flushEventListeners();
     - This should be run before executing the create method of a model

Dealing with Failing-Prone Actions
     - surround your Mail sending action with the retry('times to retry', function() use Model{ 'actions' }, 'milliseconds to retry again (100)') helper

Using Laravel Markdown Mailables
     - php artisan make:mail Test -m emails.test
     - creates for us a Mailable class and a corresponding view
     - available from Laravel 5.4*
